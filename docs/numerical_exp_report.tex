\section*{Introduction}
The Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop \Cyclus in-situ demand-driven deployment capabilities through non-optimizing, deterministic-optimizing and stochastic-optimizing prediction algorithms.

These prediction models are being developed by the University of South Carolina. In this report, we discuss numerical experiments for testing the non-optimizing, deterministic and stochastic optimizing methods. 

\section{Once through Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
This section evaluates the required tests for
each method assuming a once-through fuel cycle.

\node (fuelfab) [process, right of=enrichment] {\texttt{FuelFab}};

\node (sink) [process, right of=reactor]{\texttt{Sink}};

\subsection*{Non-optimizing prediction method}
Conditions to satisfy: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  Do all the \texttt{Reactor}s run at full capacity (not lacking fuel)? 

\item Is the predicted fuel demand within a specific uncertainty of the analytic solution? 

\item  Is the output of the \texttt{Fuelfab} within a specific range (more than?) of the input required by the \texttt{Reactor}s (calculated by the analytic solution) for all of them to run for each time step? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Is a new \texttt{Fuelfab} deployed when the input required by the reactors exceeds the output of current \texttt{Fuelfab}?
\item Is a \texttt{Fuelfab} decommissioned when the input required by the reactors falls behind the output of current \texttt{Fuelfab} facilities?
\end{itemize}

\item  Is the output of the \texttt{Enrichment} within a specific range of the input required by the \texttt{Fuelfab} (calculated by the analytic solution) for each time step? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Is a new \texttt{Enrichment} deployed when the input required by the \texttt{Fuelfab} exceeds the output of current \texttt{Enrichment} facilities?
\item Is a \texttt{Enrichment} decommissioned when the input required by the \texttt{Fuelfab} falls behind the output of current \texttt{Enrichment}?
\end{itemize}

\item Is the output of \texttt{Source} within a specific range of the input required by the \texttt{Enrichment} (calculated by the analytic solution) for each time step? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the \texttt{Source} output increase when the input required by the \texttt{Enrichment} exceeds the output of current \texttt{Source}?
\item Does the \texttt{Source} output decrease when the input required by the \texttt{Enrichment} falls behind the output of current \texttt{Source}?
\end{itemize}

\section{Advanced Fuel Cycles}
Advanced fuel cycles denote the fuel cycles
where reprocessing of spent fuel takes place,
to create fuel for advanced reactors.
