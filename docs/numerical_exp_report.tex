\section*{Introduction}
The Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project (NEUP-FY16-10512) aims to develop \Cyclus in-situ demand-driven deployment capabilities through non-optimizing, deterministic-optimizing and stochastic-optimizing prediction algorithms.

These prediction models are being developed by the University of South Carolina. In this report, we discuss numerical experiments for testing the non-optimizing, deterministic and stochastic optimizing methods. 

\section{Once through Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
This section evaluates the required tests for
each method assuming a once-through fuel cycle.

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Flow Chart of Once through Nuclear Fuel Cycle}
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=3.5cm]
\node (source) [process] {\texttt{Source}};
\node (enrichment) [process, right of=source] {\texttt{Enrichment}};
\node (fuelfab) [process, right of=enrichment] {\texttt{FuelFab}};
\node (reactor) [process, right of=fuelfab]{\texttt{Reactor}};
\node (sink) [process, right of=reactor]{\texttt{Sink}};

\draw [arrow] (source) -- (enrichment); 
\draw [arrow] (enrichment) -- (fuelfab); 
\draw [arrow] (fuelfab) -- (reactor);
\draw [arrow] (reactor) -- (sink);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Non-optimizing prediction method}
Conditions to satisfy: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  Do all the \texttt{Reactor}s run at full capacity (not lacking fuel)? 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
TEST(ReactorTests, DDDeploy_NO) {
    [Example input with the following attributes:]
        [int simdur = 20;]
        [Defines reactor with zero refueling cycle and operation cycle of 1 month]
        [Defines fuel cycle facilities parameters]
        [Defines Reactor Deploy Scheme / Power Demand]
        [Increasing Fuel Demand with Time]
    [Run test]
    [Test if Reactor has no zero values in output Timeseriespower]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\item Is the predicted fuel demand within a specific uncertainty of the analytic solution? 

\item  Is the output of the \texttt{Fuelfab} within a specific range (more than?) of the input required by the \texttt{Reactor}s (calculated by the analytic solution) for all of them to run for each time step? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Is a new \texttt{Fuelfab} deployed when the input required by the reactors exceeds the output of current \texttt{Fuelfab}?
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
TEST(ReactorTests, DDDeploy_NO) {
    [Example input with the following attributes:]
        [int simdur = 20;]
        [Defines reactor with zero refueling cycle and operation cycle of 1 month]
        [Defines fuel cycle facilities parameters]
        [Defines Reactor Deploy Scheme / Power Demand]
        [Increasing Fuel Demand with Time]
    [Run test]
    [Test if Fuelfab is deployed in the beginning]
    [Test if Fuelfab is deployed later in the simulation (have analytic solution)]
}
\end{lstlisting}
\item Is a \texttt{Fuelfab} decommissioned when the input required by the reactors falls behind the output of current \texttt{Fuelfab} facilities?
\end{itemize}

\item  Is the output of the \texttt{Enrichment} within a specific range of the input required by the \texttt{Fuelfab} (calculated by the analytic solution) for each time step? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Is a new \texttt{Enrichment} deployed when the input required by the \texttt{Fuelfab} exceeds the output of current \texttt{Enrichment} facilities?
\item Is a \texttt{Enrichment} decommissioned when the input required by the \texttt{Fuelfab} falls behind the output of current \texttt{Enrichment}?
\end{itemize}

\item Is the output of \texttt{Source} within a specific range of the input required by the \texttt{Enrichment} (calculated by the analytic solution) for each time step? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Does the \texttt{Source} output increase when the input required by the \texttt{Enrichment} exceeds the output of current \texttt{Source}?
\item Does the \texttt{Source} output decrease when the input required by the \texttt{Enrichment} falls behind the output of current \texttt{Source}?
\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}


However, the user may not have his or her cycle set to the generic fuel cycle, and may have
variations so that there is no \texttt{Fuelfab} or \texttt{Enrichment}, but the fuel is
directly supplied by the \texttt{Source}. This brings the need for the algorithm to recognize
the supply chain the supply fuel to the reactor, and deploy necessary facilities accordingly. 


\subsection*{Deterministic-Optimizing/Stochastic prediction method}
Conditions for test to satisfy: 
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}


\section{Advanced Fuel Cycles}
Advanced fuel cycles denote the fuel cycles
where reprocessing of spent fuel takes place,
to create fuel for advanced reactors.
