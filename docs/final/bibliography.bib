	abstract = {This study has identiï¬ed ï¬exible, general, and performant algorithms available for application to simulating demand-driven deployment of nuclear fuel cycle facility capacity in a fuel cycle simulator. Accordingly, a review of current Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) simulation tools was conducted to determine their current capabilities for demand-driven and transition scenarios. Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains such as economics and industrial engineering Finally, the applicability of such algorithms in the context of challenging nuclear fuel cycle simulation questions has been described.},
